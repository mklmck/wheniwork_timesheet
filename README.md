# Next Steps for Error Handling

If more time were spent on this project, the following error handling improvements would be implemented:

1. **Validation of Input Data**: Ensuring that the JSON data provided to `parseShifts` function conforms to expected structure and contains all necessary fields. This would include checking for the existence and correct format of `EmployeeID`, `StartTime`, and `EndTime`.

2. **Handling File Read/Write Errors**: The `fs.readFileSync` and `fs.writeFileSync` methods should have try/catch blocks around them to handle any file system errors, such as the file not existing, permission issues, or the file being in use by another process.

3. **Graceful Handling of Date Parsing**: Dates are parsed using the `Date` constructor. However, if invalid date strings are provided, this could cause issues. We would add checks to ensure the dates are valid after parsing.

4. **Dealing with DST Transitions**: The calculation currently takes into account the timezone offsets, but more rigorous testing around daylight saving time transitions is required to ensure accuracy.

5. **Overlapping Shifts**: The code attempts to detect overlapping shifts but does not yet handle them in terms of adjusting hours. We would add logic to adjust hours appropriately or reject overlapping shifts, depending on the business rules.

6. **Comprehensive Testing**: We would add a suite of unit tests using Jest to cover all edge cases, such as shifts that span multiple weeks, shifts during the transition from standard time to daylight saving time and vice versa, and malformed input data.

7. **Logging**: Incorporate a logging library to log errors and important information, which helps in debugging and maintaining the application.

8. **API Error Handling**: If the application were to be extended to include an API for inputting shifts, we would implement proper HTTP status codes and error messages for the responses.

## Where to Find Custom Code

The custom code that we've added can be found primarily in the `parseShifts` function. This is where the logic for processing shifts, calculating regular and overtime hours, and handling edge cases is contained.

To easily spot the code added, look for the following sections within the `parseShifts` function:

- Initialization of `employeeWorkHours` object
- Sorting and processing of shifts
- Splitting shifts that cross over weeks
- Calculating total regular and overtime hours
- Writing the results to the `result.json` file

Each of these sections contains custom logic that is critical to the application's functionality.

## Programming Language

This application is written in JavaScript (Node.js). However, the principles of error handling and code structure applied here can be translated to any other programming language as needed.
